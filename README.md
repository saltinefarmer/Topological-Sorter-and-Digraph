# Topological-Sorter-and-Digraph

## What this Project is
This project was the final assignment for my advanced algorithms course. This was meant to test our understanding of and ability to implement the digraph structure and topological sorting algorithm. It also was required that our topological sorter be able to manage cycles in the digraph, and be able to instead sort the strongly connected components.

## Involved Parties
The topologicalsorter.py and digraph.py were created by myself. The tasksorter.py was created by the instructing professor Dr. Adam A. Smith. It was supplied to utilize our code for testing purposes.

## References
The textbook used for this course was Algorithms(4th Edition), authored by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

## Instructions
The topologicalsorter.py and digraph.py cannot be run by themselves. They must be utilized through the tasksorter.py file. To use the task sorter, enter the name of the file you wish to sort the contents of. The file name must end in .task. In this text file, each line will items to be sorted, and items sharing a line have a dependency.
